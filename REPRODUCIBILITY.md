# Reproducibility Parameters

This file summarizes the numerical parameters used in the published analysis.

## Boundary Definition (TPT)

- Inner boundary Ri = 5.3 A
- Outer boundary Ro = 9.1 A

Boundaries are defined using the cluster-based nearest-counterion distance described in Supplementary Note S1.
